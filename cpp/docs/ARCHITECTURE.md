# Multi-Paradigm and Multi-Language Architecture

## Overview

Agent Zero's C++ backend is designed from the ground up to support multiple programming paradigms and multiple programming languages, making it one of the most flexible AI agent frameworks available.

## Multi-Paradigm Programming

### 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

The primary interface uses modern C++ OOP principles with inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

### 2. Functional Programming

High-order functions, immutability, and function composition are supported through the `functional` namespace.

### 3. Procedural Programming

C-style procedural interface for maximum compatibility with legacy code and FFI.

### 4. Generic Programming

Template-based generic algorithms that work with any compatible types.

## Multi-Language Support

The Multi-Language Bridge provides a unified interface for executing code in different programming languages:

- **Python**: Native bindings via pybind11
- **JavaScript/Node.js**: Native add-ons via N-API
- **Go**: Planned integration
- **Rust**: Planned integration

### Cross-Language Execution

Execute code from one language in another, enabling true polyglot development.

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Choose the right paradigm for each task
2. **Interoperability**: Seamless integration across languages
3. **Performance**: Native C++ speed with multi-language accessibility
4. **Developer Experience**: Use familiar paradigms and languages

See the full documentation in MULTI_PARADIGM_LANGUAGES.md for detailed examples and use cases.
